Implement a function `accuracy` that assesses quality of the dictionaries you return from `method_one` and `method_two`.  This accuracy function should return a single real number (the accuracy), and its input parameters are a prediction dict (the output of your model) and a truth dict (which you will need to create based on your own judgement). Make sure that the accuracies you calculate for the two methods match what you expect. "
